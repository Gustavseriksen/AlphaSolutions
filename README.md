# Welcome to the Alpha Solutions project.


## Description of the code
This project is used to help the Alpha Solutions company manage their on-going projects, but is also useful for other companies if a simplified site is needed for new projects.
Our code can help both small companies as well as bigger coorparations manage their projects in a simple way. 



### How the program works.
We have decided to split up between 3 roles: 
- Admin, Project manager, Employee.
Those 3 roles have different acceses:

### The admin role is used to:
- Add new project managers
- Add new employees
Within tthe company, so they have the access to the different projects.

### The project manager role is used to:
- Create new projects
  - Sub-projects
  - tasks
- All the necessities for the projects, sub-projects and tasks. (Time-estimate, end-date, etc.)
- Add employees to projects, sub-projects or tasks

### The employee role is used to: 
- Mark tasks as done
